## Problem Statement -
 - The Dual Risks of Faulty Wiring and Structural Damage in Aircraft

## Problems Faced -
 - Aircraft maintenance ensures safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance. Assessing and repairing damage and faulty wiring are essential for flight safety.
 - Structural damage and faulty wiring can lead to catastrophic failures, in-flight emergencies, or fires, endangering passengers and crew.
 - Regular inspections and timely repairs are crucial to prevent accidents and maintain public confidence in aviation

## Idea Approach -
 - Trained, tested, built and deployed models using different algorithms to compare and differentiate accuracy and results from training basic CNN model to advanced  deep learning based object detection model.
 - Utilized generative AI chatbots to provide repair recommendations, conduct damage assessments, and aid in risk mitigation for aircraft, enhancing maintenance efficiency.
 - Integrated scalable features that enable real-time image/video processing for damage detection through external sources such as IoT-based models.
 - Implemented CAD 3D projection that visualizes the shortest path to locate damage using Dijkstra’s algorithm, optimizing repair procedures and reducing downtime
